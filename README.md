The objective of this project was to apply the things that i learned about my first aproximation to the React Framework.
I learned the differences between functional and class components, the use of states and props.

## Main TakeAways and Difficulties
For this project, i had to also learn about the <bold>useContext</bold> hook,  this was not covered on the lessons in the Odin Project (now it is), and about ReactRouter. I had to use because i needed to keep the products in the cart consisten betwwen routes, and passsing states and props between all the routes and components was a mess.
I think that this a key concept for larger apps or when one need persistent data and is working with various components/routes.
